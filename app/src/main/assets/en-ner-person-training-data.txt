Hey isn’t that .?.?. Canada’s photogenic Prime Minister <START:person> Justin Trudeau <END> and his wife, <START:person> Sophie Grégoire Trudeau <END>, having date night in SEI in Penn Quarter?
<START:person> Trudeau <END> has had a busy few days in Washington.
On Tuesday evening, he spoke at a dinner held for Fortune Magazine‘s Most Powerful Women Summit — and sat next to his new buddy, first daughter <START:person> Ivanka Trump <END>, adviser to the president.
The next day, <START:person> Trudeau <END> headed to 1600 Pennylvania Ave. to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement with President <START:person> Trump <END>, who isn’t a fan of the trade deal.
Amid mounting tension surrounding the NAFTA negotiations, <START:person> Trudeau <END> told the Telegraph that the talks were “not easy.”
After a business trip like that, the 45-year-old world leader clearly needed a night off.
He and <START:person> Sophie <END> , who spent time with first lady <START:person> Melania Trump <END> on Wednesday, arrived at the modern Asian restaurant just after 8 p.m. sans entourage or interruption.
The couple wasn’t recognized and spent a quiet hour together noshing on truffle sashimi and pork buns.

For years, <START:person> Elon Musk <END> has been focused on building a colony on Mars.
That's why he founded SpaceX in 2002, and it’s been the driving force behind the company ever since.
But during a speech in Adelaide, Australia, on Friday morning, <START:person> Musk <END> said he has dramatically expanded his already-outsize ambitions.
In addition to helping create a city on the Red Planet, he said the next rocket he intends to build could be used to establish a base camp on the moon — and fly people across the globe.
“It’s 2017, we should have a lunar base by now,” he said during a 40-minute speech at the International Astronautical Congress.
“What the hell has been going on?”
In a surprise twist, he also said his planned massive rocket and spaceship, which would have more pressurized passenger space than an Airbus A380 airplane, could fly passengers anywhere on Earth in less than an hour.
Traveling at a maximum speed of nearly 17,000 mph, a trip from New York to Shanghai, for example, would take 39 minutes, he said. New York to London could be done in 29 minutes.
At the speech a year ago, <START:person> Musk <END> unveiled a behemoth of a rocket that was so ambitious and mind-bogglingly large that critics said it was detached from reality.
Now, he and his team at SpaceX have done some editing, and <START:person> Musk <END> presented a revised plan early Friday to build a massive, but more reasonably sized, rocket that he calls the BFR, or Big [expletive] Rocket.

Two days before Washington found itself in the orbit of <START:person> the Weeknd <END>, when the video for his single “Starboy” officially surpassed 1 billion YouTube views. 
In it, the Canadian crooner kidnaps and suffocates a version of his former self, destroying any evidence of its existence. 
So when his shape-shifting Star Destroyer landed Thursday night in the packed Verizon Center to open his set with an electrifying performance of that same single, it felt like bearing witness to an opulent celebration.
For fans of <START:person> the Weeknd <END> around the time of his 2011 debut mixtape “House of Balloons,” it was hard to imagine this point. 
His songs then were atmospheric and drug-laden in both feel and lyrical content (the latter hasn’t changed much). 
They felt as distant as he was. 
But as his star grew, so too did his sound, as ornate pop music all but replaced his ambient R&B. 
Synths and hollow electronics were swallowed by textured instrumentation — in the case of live performance, courtesy of his three-man band on drums, guitar, bass and keys.
Still, the mark of a truly great pop star lies in the ability to widen his appeal without neglecting the evolution of his own art. 
The fans are always craving their favorite versions of an artist, and there have to be through lines for when the 1,000-capacity smoke-filled rooms inevitably become 18,000-capacity arenas. 
<START:person> The Weeknd <END> achieved this beautifully.
